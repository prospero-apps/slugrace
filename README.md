# slugrace

A 2D game made with Python and Kivy. It can be played by up to four players. Each player places a bet on one of four racing slugs and they either win or lose money. The game is over when there's only one player left with any money, but you can set a different ending condition in the settings screen too, like after a given number of races or after a set period of time.
